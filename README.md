# CoffeeShop-React

An interactive and fully responsive website built with React. Provides the user with details about Quick Brew coffee shop. This includes reviews, daily events, and an interactive menu. I also created a shop with Commerce.js and connected it to Stripe for the ability to accept payments.

## How It Works

The website is used for both information and a shop for the Quick Brew coffee shop. The Home page displays information in regards to the coffee shop. At the bottom the user can find some reviews that can be changed with a clicker on the left or the right side of the reviews. The Events page displays the events that take place throughout the week. The Menu page includes an interactive menu that the user can change by clicking on one of the headers. 

The Shop page is used to add items to the user's cart. The user can search through the different items based on categories. The user can then click on the bag icon on the item card to add it to their cart. The cart can be seen by clicking on the bag icon in the top right of the page. The user can delete or alter the amount of the item on this page. When the checkout button is pressed, the user will be prompted to input their shipping and payment details for their items. 

## Software Used

I built this website on React and used Sass for styling it. I also used Commerce.js and Stripe to build the shop part of the site and collect the payments. 

## What I learned 

This was my first website build on React and it provided me with a lot of experience as a result. I learned more about the best ways to use hooks and some npm packages that are quite beneficial to use when making a website. My favorite in this project was using the React Router Dom. I learned a lot about making a website that is user friendly.

I also learned a lot about e-commerce websites and how they work. Using commerce.js and Stripe made the process very easy.
